      <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>

<p><em>(last update: Jan 13th 2022)</em></p>

<p>Most influencers in the crypto/NFT space are not transparent about their own trading. Some may highlight a few winning trades to build some reputation. Many won’t tell you, most importantly, when the project they’re talking about is one that they themselves have bought up cheap, and want to sell out of. Some use secret wallets to do this dumping.</p>

<p>I believe this is unethical behaviour.</p>

<p>In the spirit of inspiring better behaviour from everyone else, I’m trying to set a high standard for what should be expected: namely total transparency over both current positions and past positions, with a public trading journal that explains why trades were made, why things are listed, etc. More thoughts on this <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1479125861886578693">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am not yet an influencer. At the time of writing, I am slowly approaching 10k followers. Most people who call themselves influencers in the NFT space have more than 10 times the followers. This also means that doing this is easier for me - I don’t have thousands of trades to account for.</p>

<p>I hope that I will inspire other influencers to at least publish a subset of what I’m including in their own transparency report. I also hope that seeing a breakdown of how I’ve come about these opportunities and how I think about them can be instructive to others (if only to avoid my dumbest mistakes).</p>

<p>I will do my best to update this page at least weekly to keep track of my trades, so you always know exactly what my position is, when I talk about a project.</p>

<p>Also worth noting that I am including both my and my wife’s portfolio in this, since she trades based on my advice and I do indirectly benefit from her making good trades.</p>

<p>I am not including ENS domain names in this as I don’t buy them for trading. I am also not including polygon NFTs that I paid nothing for, especially all the scammy ones that were airdropped to my wallet to try and drain it!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-crypto">What about crypto?</h3>

<p>I am not including crypto trading here for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) I don’t actually tweet about crypto coins much. I don’t think my word has any weight in that space.</p>

<p>2) I don’t really know what I’m doing in crypto. My area of specialisation is clearly NFT projects, so that’s where I will focus.</p>

<p>If this changes, I will of course adjust.</p>

<h3 id="addresses-to-track"><a name="addresses"></a>Addresses to track</h3>

<p>My addresses are <a href="http://swombat.eth.xyz">swombat.eth</a> and 0x61860BFFdAc4e904a4Bd0aB2dd8BDC29Fd86d38b . My wife’s addresses are <a href="http://iampow.eth.xyz">iampow.eth</a> and 0xd20fff02825ef40fd46c287f77f9c12253f9379e . I am including all four of these addresses in this and I hereby publicly commit that I am not trading on any other addresses.</p>

<p>If I start trading on other addresses I will update this section within one week.</p>

<h3 id="final-disclaimer">Final disclaimer</h3>

<p>If you want to try to copy my trades, nobody can stop you. It’s probably a bad idea, but who knows, it might work out. I strongly advise you to research projects yourself and not buy them just because I say some good words about them. Also please consider entry prices before buying a project. Even if you believe it’s going to 10 eth, it’s much more risky to buy a project at 1 eth than at 0.1. So if I bought in at 0.1, and say it’s going to 10, and you buy at 1, you are actually taking a substantially higher risk and this may not be worthwhile.</p>

<h3 id="active-portfolio">Active portfolio</h3>

<p>These are NFTs that I am holding with a hope of getting a return.</p>

<h4 id="llamaverse"><a name="llama"></a>Llamaverse</h4>

<p>This is one of my most bullish investments, perhaps because I’m also actively involved in building out the project. Llamaverse is a club for NFT investors. It hasn’t even fully launched yet (PFPs are coming in late January), and yet it is providing the most utility of any of my projects. I was an early backer, before there was an NFT at all, and though the project went through a period of uncertainty when the focus wasn’t clear, it’s now sharper than ever and I only see it going up from here.</p>

<p>I hold 2 gold passes (one on behalf of my wife). One was bought before there was an NFT available at all, by transferring 0.95 Eth to <a href="http://twitter.com/NftLlama">NFTLlama</a>. The other one, bought on secondary at 1.5 Eth. I also hold 6 silver passes (2 on behalf of my wife), bought at: 0.099, 0.1, 0.089, 0.249, 0.25.</p>

<p>Why don’t I hold even more? Because even though I am super bullish, I only have so much liquidity and I want to spread my investments across many projects that I believe in.</p>

<p>My longer term price target for Llamaverse is 2-10 eth for the silver pass, and 20-100 eth for the gold pass.</p>

<h4 id="crypto-coven"><a name="coven"></a>Crypto Coven</h4>

<p>Oh man. I love this project. I was one of the earliest on the Discord, I loved the vibe. I got in the “first witches” community sale and minted three at 0.05 each. I also got my wife to mint 3.</p>

<p>I believe Crypto Coven is a very well executed <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1470364102308601862">NFT club</a>, with a much more feminine, go with the flow vibe that suits its intended audience (witchy, spiritual people) exceedingly well (unlike the very aggressive vibe in most NFT project Discords).</p>

<p>I considered selling some of my initial ones when the project first pumped to 0.2 or so… and decided against it, because I really liked owning witches 126, 127 and 128! Instead, I’ve periodically bought one or two more when the price goes down to 0.1-ish. My price target for this project, where I will start selling witches, is about 1-2 eth.</p>

<p>I’ve flipped one of the witches I bought for about .1, for .29, to derisk a little. I might continue taking profits on the way up if the project keeps rising steadily, until my investment is risk-free. If it dips back down, I  might well buy back in again.</p>

<h4 id="curious-addys-trading-club-catc"><a name="catc"></a>Curious Addy’s Trading Club (CATC)</h4>

<p>I’ve written about CATC before, with regards to their <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1460754026211983361">smart contract mint lockup</a>, which I hope will become a common feature (with some tweaks) of serious project mints, just like vesting is a common feature for startups.</p>

<p>I like this project because the team is <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1478184915120316416">Level-4 doxxed</a>, they have a <a href="https://medium.com/@curious_addys_trading_club/roadmap-for-curious-addys-trading-club-a4bc5ab34455">unique roadmap that actually reads like a plan to do something</a> instead of a bunch of copy pasta, they have a powerful vision (onboard the next million people), and the Discord is a pleasant place to hangout. And they’re inclusive too.</p>

<p>And importantly they’re also risk-free, with a smart contract that guarantees a refund of the mint price up to 100 days after mint. The mint price was 0.08. I bought most of these below 0.08. So this is an extremely low risk bet that they can make something happen in the first 100 days. If they can’t, I may return some or all of them, I haven’t decided, but it’s nice to have the choice.</p>

<p>I have one listed at .5 in case it randomly pumps (that would derisk all my investment, though not my wife’s). But generally I have a price target of 1-2 eth for this project at the moment.</p>

<h4 id="zenecademy-genesis"><a name="zenecademy"></a>Zenecademy Genesis</h4>

<p>I caught this mint just before it finished. I made a quick decision: it’s an investment club, similar to Llamaverse (see lower), and I am bullish on those clubs. And I believe that <a href="http://twitter.com/Zeneca_33">Zeneca</a> is one of the more reputable, credible, ethical influencers in the space. So I minted 3, at 0.03. I flipped one at 0.1 to derisk and will be holding the other two for a number of months to see where this goes. My price target for this is similar to Llamaverse Silver pass, so about 2-10 eth.</p>

<h4 id="non-fungible-people"><a name="nfp"></a>Non Fungible People</h4>

<p>This was a presale whitelist opportunity from <a href="https://twitter.com/Llamaverse_">Llamaverse</a>. Originally I was just going to mint and flip. But after derisking by selling one for 0.16, I looked more into the project and decided that because it is started by a legitimate company and I can see a potential business case for it, I am going to hold the second one (now it is entirely derisked), probably for a few months, to see where the project goes. This was directly contradicting my suggestion around avoiding the <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1468235357099540488">Investrading trap</a> but I think it was a conscious decision.</p>

<p>I don’t have a price target for this but I suspect it will stabilise above 1 eth. So my plan is to forget about it for a few months - or maybe sell on a pump and buy back in on a dip. We’ll see.</p>

<h4 id="enigma-economy"><a name="enigma"></a>Enigma Economy</h4>

<p>Enigma is a wonderful and straightforward investment. The money is going to buy actual Ethereum mining equipment (servers and GPUs) and is being put to use for the purpose of building mining nodes and sharing the rewards.</p>

<p>Unlike many scams (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNNkLgw9g8">Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfZi7jkKlwY">Thor</a>), which claim to set up “nodes” for you but do nothing of the sort, there’s actual physical equipment being bought and set up (receipts have been posted along with photos of the gear), and an actual incorporated business. Of course, it could all <em>still</em> be some elaborate scam, so do your own research, but as far as I can tell this is a legitimate mining business raising money via NFTs.</p>

<p>I happily bought in (3 at 0.16, 0.172 and 0.135), and got my wife to as well (6 at 0.17, 0.174, 0.185, 0.19, 0.19, 0.2 and 0.209 🧹), and we’ve staked all of them and will likely continue to do so to collect the mining rewards. I see it as a lower-hassle, easier version of buying some gear and setting up a mining node under my desk. 1) it doesn’t heat up my flat, and 2) it’s less likely to melt down or set my flat on fire in the London summer.</p>

<p>I have also minted 3 v3s at 0.15 per, and got my wife to mint 3 as well (and she minted an Expert). Currently mine are staked and I’m still deciding what to do with that expert.</p>

<h4 id="expansion-punks"><a name="expunks"></a>Expansion Punks</h4>

<p>I found out about this project from a well connected friend’s tip. I looked into it and liked their thinking. The way they went about explaining how they designed their project <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/expansionpunks-welcome-to-the-more-inclusive-punkverse-aa77e675bcf5">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/a-more-diverse-and-inclusive-punkverse-da2a27db8911">here</a> got my attention. The fact that the founding team is at least <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1478184915120316416">Level 2 doxxed</a>, and maybe Level 3, was also a plus. So I decided to invest even though the core pitch for this project is one I’ve literally listed as the <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1475989977356017664">least plausible pitch for any project</a> (aka: “we’re going to be the next cryptopunks”).</p>

<p>Mint was .06. I minted 5 and got my wife to mint 5. I derisked when the price hit .1. Do I wish I’d held longer? Heck yeah. Since then ExPunks have hit a .85 ATH and they look like they’re still heading upwards. I wouldn’t buy more right now, but I may try some trading during the next pump, if I can sell into the top of the pump and buy back more on the dip. We shall see. Either way, I’ll hold at least one as a very long term, zero risk investment, in case they <em>do</em> achieve their unlikely goal of reaching Cryptopunks status.</p>

<p>I bought one of those to check out the gated parts of the project, since it seemed like an interesting NFT club for builders and… never really got around to doing it. I’m still holding it. Maybe some day I’ll actually get around to checking it out properly…</p>

<h3 id="unlikelyunwise-investments">Unlikely/unwise investments</h3>

<p>These are investments that are pretty unwise in retrospect, and I’m keeping an eye on them to get out of them if they do manage another pump, even with a loss.</p>

<h4 id="flipmaps"><a name="flipmaps"></a>Flipmaps</h4>

<p>Let’s start with the most recent, most painful one. I missed the 0.03 mint for Flipmaps (“looks nice, lemme have a look at it tomorrow - oh shit it’s minted out”) and, like an idiot, FOMO’ed into it at .1. At the time of writing the floor has rolled back down to 0.03. Not coincidentally, I wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1478385735187238914">this thread</a> shortly afterwards. I’m holding and monitoring this hoping there will be another pump for me to get out on, but not hugely hopeful.</p>

<p>These are the leftovers of the original crypto coven contract getting locked up because of a bug. They’re not supposed to be worth anything. And yet they exist. Apparently the team may do something about them. One sold for .4 Eth recently (!) so I figured, screw it, I’ll list one for .55. Maybe it’ll sell? Extremely unlikely, but who knows lol. Welcome to NFTs.</p>

<p>Update: To my shock, I have managed to sell one of these vessels for 0.55. 🙀</p>

<p>Until recently this would have been in my “dead” category, but they recently came back to life, so go figure. This was another total degen move (in the middle of a bear market no less!). I found the art hilarious, and it was a free mint. I don’t have high expectations of this, but who knows, right?</p>

<p>This was a free mint for holding lions, so not exactly an investment.

If they reach a decent price I’ll probably sell them.</p>

<h4 id="the-glitches"><a name="glitches"></a>The Glitches</h4>

<p>I’ve got mixed feelings about this project. I minted it and bought up because I sensed that it could do well. I still think it could have, and maybe it can still recover. There’s something that I can’t quite put my finger on…</p>

<p>That said, it clearly didn’t work out. It might go up again, who knows. I mostly feel bad that I gave one of these (the last one) to my wife as a birthday present. If it goes back up I’ll start selling to derisk, and may hold one or two just in case.</p>

<p>I bought into this because it was a Llamaverse call (back in that post-bull period where the calls were lower quality). It’s not a rug, but it’s not a project I should ever have bought into. As far as I can tell there is no long term sustainable value here. I’d be happy to get out with a 50% haircut here. Maybe some of them will sell. It has occasionally had little pumps.</p>

<p>I bought into this - wait no, I got <em>my wife</em> to buy into this - because it was a Llamaverse call (back in that post-bull period where the calls were lower quality). It’s not a rug, but it’s not a project we should ever have bought into. Maybe it will go back up. It’s not a rug, after all, just a not-so-great project. We’ll see.</p>

<p>PS: For a brief time, the price did pump up to above .2… Then it went back down again. Missed trading opportunity, or maybe there was some pump and dumping going on and we ended up some kind of bag-holder.</p>

<p>Oh my. This one wins the “missed opportunity” crown. It was a free mint, obvious degen move, but then I traded like an idiot. It pumped after mint, I sold one for .08… then someone on a Discord said you needed 5 for the “utility” and I did not recognise that “utility” as “ponzi shite”… so I bought back in at .065.</p>

<p>Now they’re utterly worthless, which was kind of predictable. The project was <em>not</em> helped by the fact that it developed a weird subculture where everyone would speak in all caps and add “not” randomly throughout their sentences, so that whatever you said was meant to be the opposite of the literal meaning of what you said. Folks - communication is hard enough in regular english.</p>

<p>I mostly feel bad about this one because I could have made a nice .4 or so from selling during that one and only pump and… did not.</p>

<p>This is me being dumb. I saw those talked about on the Llamaverse Discord. I said, “wtf, they just look like cheap windows screensavers”. People replied “no man, they’re really beautiful! They’re definitely going up.” Did I engage my critical mind?</p>

<p>No, I bought 3. At least they only cost .02!</p>

<p>It was my first free mint. I mostly did it because I wanted to test the transfer function with an NFT that wasn’t super expensive. It never went anywhere, which is a little sad, but wasn’t a huge expense, other than the gas.</p>

<p>These are projects that I’ve traded and since exited. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not worth holding, it just means I’ve not chosen to buy back in, at least not yet.</p>

<p>This was a Llamaverse call, and the one that has worked out the best for me so far. Bought 3 at 0.23, 0.23 and 0.244, and sold them at 0.544, 1.26 and 1.26. Not counting royalties, that’s still a hefty profit. I’ve reviewed this project <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1458493657225510918">here</a> if you want to know more about it.</p>

<p>I should never have bought this. It was a degen move. But then at some point I saw it pump and took the profits/exit immediately. I later found out that notorious pump and dump’er <a href="https://twitter.com/flurnft">flur</a> had pumped it. Naturally, the pump was unsustainable and it collapsed back down and is now, as I expected, worth very little.</p>

<p>Entry at 0.07, 0.08 and 0.12, exit at 0.172 for all three.</p>

<p>They do look cute tho.</p>

<h4 id="lazy-lions"><a name="lazylions"></a>Lazy Lions</h4>

<p>Aaah, the lions. It was my first NFT, and got me to finally slip into the rabbit hole of web3. I’ll forever be thankful to this project.</p>

<p>So why did I sell? Mostly because although the Lions are really good at generating noise, the noise is always about themselves. In several months there I still could not answer why it made sense to be part of that community, what benefit <em>I</em> would get from it, beyond the ponzi benefit that “when the lions go to the moon”, I can sell for a profit to another punter. That combined with 50 different niggles over those months, from atrocious moderation practices to poor engagement of the community (treating them as twitter cows to milk for tweets rather than as co-builders of the project), lack of transparency over finances, undoxxed team, a cleverly disguised obsession with floor prices (the whole “diamond paws” thing which I’ve highlighted as a roadmap antipattern), and a few botched deliveries like Bungalows (which never acknowledged how bad it was that 2,500 ppl minted them for the huge price of 0.3 eth and basically lost all that)… Then there was the fact that this was the most expensive, and thereby most risky, project that I had in my portfolio.</p>

<p>Eventually, I had enough, and I sold out and advised my wife to sell out. She made a decent profit and I made a small loss. Of course the lions immediately pumped right after I sold but that’s just sod’s law. Don’t look back.</p>

<p>I’m happy I don’t have this huge risk on my NFT balance sheet any longer.</p>

<p>Entry points: For me, 0.59, 0.6 and 0.89… which I almost sold at the 3.1 top (I called it, but my wife talked me out of it “because it will go higher!” 🤦). I then doubled down on this mistake by buying another one at 2.2 “to flip”, after doing a bit of switcheroo to get a rainbow mane lion (sold one I didn’t like for 3.1 and bought the one I wanted for 2.99). On the whole, my exit price then was: 1.045, 1.14, 1.15, 1.04, which works out as a 0.095 increase - but that got more than eaten up by royalties.</p>

<p>My wife only made the first trading mistake, not the second one, so she got off much better despite a higher entry: 0.85, 0.78 and 0.8 entry point. 1.19, 1.17 and 1.046 exits, for a nearly 1 eth profit (of course diminished by royalties and OpenSea fees and gas).</p>

<p>Got Whitelist for this project via Llamaverse. I looked at it and it seems interesting but I didn’t feel drawn to staying invested in it long term. I minted for 0.125 and flipped for 0.6 (though with 10% royalties) within half an hour. Best of luck to the project, but it doesn’t feel like the right fit for me!</p>
