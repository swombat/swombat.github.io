      <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>

<p><em>(last update: May 27th 2022)</em></p>

<p>Most influencers in the crypto/NFT space are not transparent about their own trading. Some may highlight a few winning trades to build some reputation. Many won’t tell you, most importantly, when the project they’re talking about is one that they themselves have bought up cheap, and want to sell out of. Some use secret wallets to do this dumping.</p>

<p>I believe this is unethical behaviour.</p>

<p>In the spirit of inspiring better behaviour from everyone else, I’m trying to set a high standard for what should be expected: namely total transparency over both current positions and past positions, with a public trading journal that explains why trades were made, why things are listed, etc. More thoughts on this <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1479125861886578693">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am not yet an influencer. At the time of writing, I am slowly approaching 10k followers. Most people who call themselves influencers in the NFT space have more than 10 times the followers. This also means that doing this is easier for me - I don’t have thousands of trades to account for.</p>

<p>I hope that I will inspire other influencers to at least publish a subset of what I’m including in their own transparency report. I also hope that seeing a breakdown of how I’ve come about these opportunities and how I think about them can be instructive to others (if only to avoid my dumbest mistakes).</p>

<p>I will do my best to update this page at least weekly to keep track of my trades, so you always know exactly what my position is, when I talk about a project.</p>

<p>Also worth noting that I am including both my and my wife’s portfolio in this, since she trades based on my advice and I do indirectly benefit from her making good trades.</p>

<p>I am not including ENS domain names in this as I don’t buy them for trading. I am also not including polygon NFTs that I paid nothing for, especially all the scammy ones that were airdropped to my wallet to try and drain it!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-crypto">What about crypto?</h3>

<p>I am not including crypto trading here for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) I don’t actually tweet about crypto coins much. I don’t think my word has any weight in that space.</p>

<p>2) I don’t really know what I’m doing in crypto. My area of specialisation is clearly NFT projects, so that’s where I will focus.</p>

<p>If this changes, I will of course adjust.</p>

<h3 id="addresses-to-track"><a name="addresses"></a>Addresses to track</h3>

<p>My addresses are <a href="http://swombat.eth.xyz">swombat.eth</a> and 0x61860BFFdAc4e904a4Bd0aB2dd8BDC29Fd86d38b . My wife’s addresses are <a href="http://iampow.eth.xyz">iampow.eth</a> and 0xd20fff02825ef40fd46c287f77f9c12253f9379e . I am including all four of these addresses in this and I hereby publicly commit that I am not trading on any other addresses.</p>

<p>If I start trading on other addresses I will update this section within one week.</p>

<p>At this point I have transferred most of the NFTs owned by both me and my wife to my vault for easier management.</p>

<h3 id="final-disclaimer">Final disclaimer</h3>

<p>If you want to try to copy my trades, nobody can stop you. It’s probably a bad idea, but who knows, it might work out. I strongly advise you to research projects yourself and not buy them just because I say some good words about them. Also please consider entry prices before buying a project. Even if you believe it’s going to 10 eth, it’s much more risky to buy a project at 1 eth than at 0.1. So if I bought in at 0.1, and say it’s going to 10, and you buy at 1, you are actually taking a substantially higher risk and this may not be worthwhile.</p>

<h3 id="active-portfolio">Active portfolio</h3>

<p>These are NFTs that I am holding with a hope of getting a return.</p>

<h4 id="little-atlas"><a name="atlas"></a>Little Atlas</h4>

<p><a href="http://littleatlas.xyz">Little Atlas</a> is not a PFP project, but a startup using NFTs in a novel way.</p>

<p>I have had many conversations with Nick, one of the founders, and have been advising this startup. I have been given 3 tiles for free, and been told that I may get an allocation of tokens if there is a token release at some point.</p>

<p>Little Atlas is, imho, the kind of project that will either be huge, or be nothing - I’m willing to invest my time and money on the possibility that it will be huge, though.</p>

<h4 id="llamaverse"><a name="llama"></a>Llamaverse</h4>

<p>This is one of my most bullish investments, perhaps because I’m also actively involved in building out the project. Llamaverse is a club for NFT investors. It hasn’t even fully launched yet (PFPs are coming in late January), and yet it is providing the most utility of any of my projects. I was an early backer, before there was an NFT at all, and though the project went through a period of uncertainty when the focus wasn’t clear, it’s now sharper than ever and I only see it going up from here.</p>

<p>I hold 2 gold passes (one on behalf of my wife). One was bought before there was an NFT available at all, by transferring 0.95 Eth to <a href="http://twitter.com/NftLlama">NFTLlama</a>. The other one, bought on secondary at 1.5 Eth. I also held 6 silver passes (2 on behalf of my wife), bought at: 0.099, 0.1, 0.089, 0.249, 0.25.</p>

<p>Why don’t I hold even more? Because even though I am super bullish, I only have so much liquidity and I want to spread my investments across many projects that I believe in. Update: seriously wish I bought more lol…</p>

<p>My longer term price target for Llamaverse is 2-10 eth for the silver pass (we’re basically there now), and 20-100 eth for the gold pass (getting there).</p>

<p>Update: we have now minted the actual pixellated llamas which will combine with the gold/silver passes/boosts above in a way that I won’t be attemptiong to sumarise here. Anyway, here are my ones:</p>

<p>Sold:</p>

<p>I sold one Llama for 1.688 and one silver pass for 0.8 Weth to reduce my risk exposure.</p>

<p>I then sold another llama for 4.85 (and and another silver boost for 1.85) to take profits:</p>

<h4 id="crypto-coven"><a name="coven"></a>Crypto Coven</h4>

<p>Oh man. I love this project. I was one of the earliest on the Discord, I loved the vibe. I got in the “first witches” community sale and minted three at 0.05 each. I also got my wife to mint 3.</p>

<p>I believe Crypto Coven is a very well executed <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1470364102308601862">NFT club</a>, with a much more feminine, go with the flow vibe that suits its intended audience (witchy, spiritual people) exceedingly well (unlike the very aggressive vibe in most NFT project Discords).</p>

<p>I considered selling some of my initial ones when the project first pumped to 0.2 or so… and decided against it, because I really liked owning witches 126, 127 and 128! Instead, I’ve periodically bought one or two more when the price goes down to 0.1-ish. My price target for this project, where I will start selling witches, used to be about 1-2 eth, but I have since revised it because, well, something else is going on with this project and I’m not sure what it is.</p>

<p>I’ve flipped one of the witches I bought for about .1, for .29, to derisk, and sould a soul vessel for .55 Eth. My investment is basically risk-free now. I will take profits as the price goes up.</p>

<h4 id="crypto-coven-soul-vessels"><a name="covenvessels"></a>Crypto Coven Soul Vessels</h4>

<p>These are the leftovers of the original crypto coven contract getting locked up because of a bug. They’re not supposed to be worth anything. And yet they exist. Apparently the team may do something about them. One sold for .4 Eth recently (!) so I figured, screw it, I’ll list one for .55. Maybe it’ll sell? Extremely unlikely, but who knows lol. Welcome to NFTs.</p>

<p>Update: To my shock, I have managed to sell one of these vessels for 0.55. 🙀</p>

<p>With further thinking, it makes sense. Though these have no utility, technically neither does the main crypto coven project - at least no clearly defined utility. There is clearly consistent demand for Crypto Coven (about 150/day for 2 weeks straight now, with a couple of pumps). There’s only 140 or so soul vessels. Naturally they will tend to be higher prices than the witches, for similar reasons that rare serums are higher priced in BAYC.</p>

<p>So I’ve shifted this from the unlikely projects category to the active portfolio.</p>

<h4 id="meta-angels"><a name="meta"></a>Meta Angels</h4>

<p>I helped the team at Meta Angels with some advice early on. They were gracious enough to reward me with a Diamond List slot which enabled me to mint 10 (at the same price as everyone else) during the pre-sale. I also got my wife on the gold list and she was able to mint 3.</p>

<p>I feel very bullish about Meta Angels, for reasons both tangible and intangible. Tangible: I have spent a long time talking to founders in general and I believe I know how to recognise when a founder is 🔥. Ally is 🔥. I’ll happily back whatever her venture is in NFTs. But also, as I’ve been close to the project as it approached mint, I’ve gotten more bullish because of the quality of execution I’ve observed, and the willingness to engage the community to help (there were 60+ ppl on the QA team manually verifying everything), and I’ve also had my belief that Ally and the Meta Angels team would be able to attract attention for the project validated by the fact that, well, they did. I also feel optimistic about the core mechanic of the project being something that will eventually be valuale - the concept is essentially translating the power of having a good, helpful network, into an NFT project designed to maximise that network’s impact.</p>

<p>More intangibly, I get a certain feeling with Meta Angels that I also got with Crypto Coven, which remains a long term hold for me. I hope I can continue to find out about projects like this.</p>

<p>I originally expected this to be a slow mint. Instead, it has felt more like a hyped mint, with the presale selling out in 6 hours or so. My position here is that I have 13, and I will wait until I need to sell at most 3 to derisk, before I do so (ideally 2). Then I will derisk and hold for the long term until I see the price stabilise somewhere.</p>

<p>Two of my angels (4953 and 1839) are on loan to friends.</p>

<h4 id="curious-addys-trading-club-catc"><a name="catc"></a>Curious Addy’s Trading Club (CATC)</h4>

<p>I’ve written about CATC before, with regards to their <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1460754026211983361">smart contract mint lockup</a>, which I hope will become a common feature (with some tweaks) of serious project mints, just like vesting is a common feature for startups.</p>

<p>I like this project because the team is <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1478184915120316416">Level-4 doxxed</a>, they have a <a href="https://medium.com/@curious_addys_trading_club/roadmap-for-curious-addys-trading-club-a4bc5ab34455">unique roadmap that actually reads like a plan to do something</a> instead of a bunch of copy pasta, they have a powerful vision (onboard the next million people), and the Discord is a pleasant place to hangout. And they’re inclusive too.</p>

<p>8 of my buys were risk-free, since they were around mint price and before the refund period ended. I decided to keep them, since the floor had since more than doubled. It has held.</p>

<p>Since then, I decided to buy in more. If the project does take off, which I think it very well might, given the founders and their network (and the fact they’re about to go through The Hug accelerator), I’m keen to have enough exposure to this project. So I now have… more.</p>

<p>I still have one listed at .5 in case it randomly pumps, because I’m too lazy to delist it, but my target is higher.</p>

<h4 id="zenacademy-genesis--333"><a name="zenacademy"></a>Zenacademy Genesis &amp; 333</h4>

<p>I caught this mint just before it finished. I made a quick decision: it’s an investment club, similar to Llamaverse (see lower), and I am bullish on those clubs. And I believe that <a href="http://twitter.com/Zeneca_33">Zeneca</a> is one of the more reputable, credible, ethical influencers in the space. So I minted 3, at 0.03. I flipped one at 0.1 to derisk with intent to hold the other two for a number of months to see where this goes. My price target for this is similar to Llamaverse Silver pass, so about 2-10 eth.</p>

<p>Since then I have seen Zeneca get renewed energy and focus, an do some hiring, to bring this project to its full value, so I’ve decided to stack up some more. At present, I have accumulated 18 Genesis passes.</p>

<p>I also have bought a 333 club membership for a whopping 3.33 eth. I’m quite happy with it so far. It’s not strictly an investments since I have no intention of reselling it, but it should be in my transparency report.</p>

<h4 id="enigma-economy"><a name="enigma"></a>Enigma Economy</h4>

<p>Enigma is a wonderful and straightforward investment. The money is going to buy actual Ethereum mining equipment (servers and GPUs) and is being put to use for the purpose of building mining nodes and sharing the rewards.</p>

<p>Unlike many scams (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNNkLgw9g8">Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfZi7jkKlwY">Thor</a>), which claim to set up “nodes” for you but do nothing of the sort, there’s actual physical equipment being bought and set up (receipts have been posted along with photos of the gear), and an actual incorporated business. Of course, it could all <em>still</em> be some elaborate scam, so do your own research, but as far as I can tell this is a legitimate mining business raising money via NFTs.</p>

<p>I happily bought in (3 at 0.16, 0.172 and 0.135), and got my wife to as well (6 at 0.17, 0.174, 0.185, 0.19, 0.19, 0.2 and 0.209 🧹), and we’ve staked all of them and will likely continue to do so to collect the mining rewards. I see it as a lower-hassle, easier version of buying some gear and setting up a mining node under my desk. 1) it doesn’t heat up my flat, and 2) it’s less likely to melt down or set my flat on fire in the London summer.</p>

<p>I have also minted 3 v3s at 0.15 per, and got my wife to mint 3 as well (and she minted an Expert). Currently mine are staked and I’m still deciding what to do with that expert.</p>

<p>For me this is a no-brainer to invest, and I might buy more if the floor sinks a bit (or even if it doesn’t). I have had a good long chat with Debbie, I can tell she’s smart and driven and capable. They’ve already organised a community of volunteers to do lots of work curating projects. They’re putting together an accelerator. They have Randi Zuckerberg as a cofounder. Will they 100% deliver? No one can know that, of course.</p>

<p>I got one free pass for offering to help with the accelerator side of things, and got on the mintlist thanks to this as well. Since then I’ve also swept 10 from the floor.</p>

<h4 id="the-rebels-by-house-of-kalinski"><a name="rebels"></a>The Rebels by House of Kalinski</h4>

<p>I <a href="https://youtu.be/dtn03roOpzQ">cold-reviewed this project</a>, and found that it ticked a lot of boxes, but I didn’t believe in the metaverse thesis. I subsequently spoke to the founder/CEO, who is also in the 333 club, and got a sense that she is aware of the possible problems with building items “for the metaverse” years before there is a metaverse (her target was also about 5y before it becomes popularised). We spoke about some other plans they might have, and I got a sense that the project has a chance. Given the incredibly low price point ($20-30) I felt like it was worth taking the risk and put in about $600.</p>

<p>My time horizon for this investment is a few years. I might derisk or take profits along the way if the price allows it, but I think I’ll keep most of them for a good while and see what they deliver. Probably would start taking profits as the price approaches 1 Eth.</p>

<p>At the same time, worth noting this is a risky investment - the price could also very much never go up, and just slide to zero. In that case, I’ll have lost $600. The risk/reward seems worth it for me.</p>

<p>So this is actually a P2E game. Yes, I know, I ranted about not investing in P2E games. Then literally a week later someone on Llamaverse gave me a tip to look into this one and… well, the game looks like it’s actually quite fun, the tokenomics make sense to me, and the tokens are being released in waves of 666 tokens and… well, I decided it was worth minting. I got 5. I’ve listed one to derisk. It will sell when it sells. Until then I’m happy to hold and see what this team do with their cool looking survival horror game.</p>

<p>This was a presale whitelist opportunity from <a href="https://twitter.com/Llamaverse_">Llamaverse</a>. Originally I was just going to mint and flip. But after derisking by selling one for 0.16, I looked more into the project and decided that because it is started by a legitimate company and I can see a potential business case for it, I am going to hold the second one (now it is entirely derisked), probably for a few months, to see where the project goes. This was directly contradicting my suggestion around avoiding the <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1468235357099540488">Investrading trap</a> but I think it was a conscious decision.</p>

<p>I don’t have a price target for this but I suspect it will stabilise above 1 eth. So my plan is to forget about it for a few months - or maybe sell on a pump and buy back in on a dip. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Update: since I got a rare, I figure I’ll try to sell it for a relatively high price. If it sells I’ll buy back 1-2 floor NFPs so I keep a toe in this.</p>

<h4 id="expansion-punks"><a name="expunks"></a>Expansion Punks</h4>

<p>I found out about this project from a well connected friend’s tip. I looked into it and liked their thinking. The way they went about explaining how they designed their project <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/expansionpunks-welcome-to-the-more-inclusive-punkverse-aa77e675bcf5">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/a-more-diverse-and-inclusive-punkverse-da2a27db8911">here</a> got my attention. The fact that the founding team is at least <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1478184915120316416">Level 2 doxxed</a>, and maybe Level 3, was also a plus. So I decided to invest even though the core pitch for this project is one I’ve literally listed as the <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1475989977356017664">least plausible pitch for any project</a> (aka: “we’re going to be the next cryptopunks”).</p>

<p>Mint was .06. I minted 5 and got my wife to mint 5. I derisked when the price hit .1. Do I wish I’d held longer? Heck yeah. Since then ExPunks have hit a .85 ATH and they look like they’re still heading upwards. I wouldn’t buy more right now, but I may try some trading during the next pump, if I can sell into the top of the pump and buy back more on the dip. We shall see. Either way, I’ll hold at least one as a very long term, zero risk investment, in case they <em>do</em> achieve their unlikely goal of reaching Cryptopunks status.</p>

<p>I thought this was an unsolicited transfer from a hacked account. It turns out someone used the collection bid feature on LooksRare to offload this Expunk to me even though it is untradeable on OpenSea. I finally figured this out. It’s likely possible to get this unblocked by OpenSea but I can’t be bothered, so I just listed it under floor and it sold. Someone else with more time can figure out how to clear this with OpenSea.</p>

<p>I bought one of those to check out the gated parts of the project, since it seemed like an interesting NFT club for builders and… never really got around to doing it. I’m still holding it. Maybe some day I’ll actually get around to checking it out properly…</p>

<p>I minted 10 of these. My reasoning is that while they are a bit similar to Crypto Coven, and not quite as good imho, the project founders seem to genuinely want to create something different (a witchy space focused on sharing art skills and knowledge). This may or may not work out, but I felt convinced enough by the founders to risk 0.5 eth. I doubt this project will follow Crypto Coven’s broomsticks to the moon, but I think it will do well enough to enable me to derisk and probably at some point take a profit, so therefore I’m happy to back the project at this point.</p>

<h4 id="floored-ape"><a name="flooredape"></a>Floored Ape</h4>

<p>Floored Ape is a tool that I’ve been using every day since I discovered it. I’ve had enough conversations with the founding team to know they’re determined to keep building what will continue to become an ever better portfolio management tool. I like the aesthetics of FA over many other similar tools.</p>

<p>Since I’ve been willing to pay 0.1 for lifetime membership of moby.gg, which I use less frequently, I think it’s not unreasonable that these lifetime membership tokens will eventually be worth that much or more. So at 0.02 per they seemed a bargain and I bought 10.</p>

<h3 id="unlikelyunwise-investments">Unlikely/unwise investments</h3>

<p>These are investments that are pretty unwise in retrospect, and I’m keeping an eye on them to get out of them if they do manage another pump, even with a loss.</p>

<p>I sheeped into this one based on hearing someone I trusted saying the alpha community was strong. It may well be, but I’ve not verified this for myself. So far it’s not done great. If the project does turn out to be better than I expected, I probably will sell when it pumps.</p>

<h4 id="flipmaps"><a name="flipmaps"></a>Flipmaps</h4>

<p>Let’s start with the most recent, most painful one. I missed the 0.03 mint for Flipmaps (“looks nice, lemme have a look at it tomorrow - oh shit it’s minted out”) and, like an idiot, FOMO’ed into it at .1. At the time of writing the floor has rolled back down to 0.03. Not coincidentally, I wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1478385735187238914">this thread</a> shortly afterwards. I’m holding and monitoring this hoping there will be another pump for me to get out on, but not hugely hopeful.</p>

<p>Until recently this would have been in my “dead” category, but they recently came back to life, so go figure. This was another total degen move (in the middle of a bear market no less!). I found the art hilarious, and it was a free mint. I don’t have high expectations of this, but who knows, right?</p>

<h4 id="lazy-lions-bungalows"><a name="bungalows"></a>Lazy Lions Bungalows</h4>

<p>This was a free mint for holding lions, so not exactly an investment. Given my issues with the Lazy Lions project, I’m not really expecting this to go anywhere, but it might, because LL is good at generating hype and some of that <em>might</em> spill over onto the Bungalows. If they reach a decent price I’ll probably sell them.</p>

<h4 id="the-glitches"><a name="glitches"></a>The Glitches</h4>

<p>I’ve got mixed feelings about this project. I minted it and bought up because I sensed that it could do well. I still think it could have, and maybe it can still recover. There’s something that I can’t quite put my finger on…</p>

<p>That said, it clearly didn’t work out. It might go up again, who knows. I mostly feel bad that I gave one of these (the last one) to my wife as a birthday present. If it goes back up I’ll start selling to derisk, and may hold one or two just in case.</p>

<p>I bought into this because it was a Llamaverse call (back in that post-bull period where the calls were lower quality). It’s not a rug, but it’s not a project I should ever have bought into. As far as I can tell there is no long term sustainable value here. I’d be happy to get out with a 50% haircut here. Maybe some of them will sell. It has occasionally had little pumps.</p>

<p>I’ve listed them for about half the price I paid for them - I don’t expect much here. But somehow one of them has sold!</p>

<p>I bought into this - wait no, I got <em>my wife</em> to buy into this - because it was a Llamaverse call (back in that post-bull period where the calls were lower quality). It’s not a rug, but it’s not a project we should ever have bought into. Maybe it will go back up. It’s not a rug, after all, just a not-so-great project. We’ll see.</p>

<p>PS: For a brief time, the price did pump up to above .2… Then it went back down again. Missed trading opportunity, or maybe there was some pump and dumping going on and we ended up some kind of bag-holder.</p>

<p>What it says on the tin. Caught this while the first 1k were free mint. The total cost to me for minting this was about $72. I felt it was a risk worth taking. The free 1k minted out in a minute or two. If they’re ever worth anything, this will turn out to be genius. If not, it’ll just be another relatively inexpensive degen move 🤷</p>

<p>I didn’t really think things through before buying into this project. And I bought into a pump, too. So extra helping of stupid there. Then I bought one more so that I could get an extra “free” 0xHunter.</p>

<p>Then the project turned out to be a rug. RIP.</p>

<p>I got this as a sorta-free mint (you needed 3 0xVampires to get one free 0xHunter, so I ended up buying another 0xVampire), so mostly just the gas is wasted. 0xVampires, its parent project, turned out to be a rug. RIP.</p>

<p>Oh my. This one wins the “missed opportunity” crown. It was a free mint, obvious degen move, but then I traded like an idiot. It pumped after mint, I sold one for .08… then someone on a Discord said you needed 5 for the “utility” and I did not recognise that “utility” as “ponzi shite”… so I bought back in at .065.</p>

<p>Now they’re utterly worthless, which was kind of predictable. The project was <em>not</em> helped by the fact that it developed a weird subculture where everyone would speak in all caps and add “not” randomly throughout their sentences, so that whatever you said was meant to be the opposite of the literal meaning of what you said. Folks - communication is hard enough in regular english.</p>

<p>I mostly feel bad about this one because I could have made a nice .4 or so from selling during that one and only pump and… did not.</p>

<p>I bought into this because it was a Llamaverse call (back in that post-bull period where the calls were lower quality). It’s not a rug afaict, but it’s not a project I should ever have bought into. Its only appeal was a perceived chance of going up because Halloween was approaching. It turns out Halloween did absolutely nothing for Halloween themed NFTs. These looked nice, but looking nice is not enough to make a successful investment.</p>

<p>In another unlikely turn of events, I’ve somehow miraculously sold 1 of them for most of what I paid for it, I think because of the crypto skulls interest recently. Four remain.</p>

<p>Another one where I can’t believe I spent nearly a thousand bucks apiece on those. 🙄</p>

<p>These are projects that I’ve traded and since exited. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not worth holding, it just means I’ve not chosen to buy back in, at least not yet.</p>

<p>This was a Llamaverse call, and the one that has worked out the best for me so far. Bought 3 at 0.23, 0.23 and 0.244, and sold them at 0.544, 1.26 and 1.26. Not counting royalties, that’s still a hefty profit. I’ve reviewed this project <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/status/1458493657225510918">here</a> if you want to know more about it.</p>

<p>I should never have bought this. It was a degen move. But then at some point I saw it pump and took the profits/exit immediately. I later found out that notorious pump and dump’er <a href="https://twitter.com/flurnft">flur</a> had pumped it. Naturally, the pump was unsustainable and it collapsed back down and is now, as I expected, worth very little.</p>

<p>Entry at 0.07, 0.08 and 0.12, exit at 0.172 for all three.</p>

<p>They do look cute tho.</p>

<h4 id="lazy-lions"><a name="lazylions"></a>Lazy Lions</h4>

<p>Aaah, the lions. It was my first NFT, and got me to finally slip into the rabbit hole of web3. I’ll forever be thankful to this project.</p>

<p>So why did I sell? Mostly because although the Lions are really good at generating noise, the noise is always about themselves. In several months there I still could not answer why it made sense to be part of that community, what benefit <em>I</em> would get from it, beyond the ponzi benefit that “when the lions go to the moon”, I can sell for a profit to another punter. That combined with 50 different niggles over those months, from atrocious moderation practices to poor engagement of the community (treating them as twitter cows to milk for tweets rather than as co-builders of the project), lack of transparency over finances, undoxxed team, a cleverly disguised obsession with floor prices (the whole “diamond paws” thing which I’ve highlighted as a roadmap antipattern), and a few botched deliveries like Bungalows (which never acknowledged how bad it was that 2,500 ppl minted them for the huge price of 0.3 eth and basically lost all that)… Then there was the fact that this was the most expensive, and thereby most risky, project that I had in my portfolio.</p>

<p>Eventually, I had enough, and I sold out and advised my wife to sell out. She made a decent profit and I made a small loss. Of course the lions immediately pumped right after I sold but that’s just sod’s law. Don’t look back.</p>

<p>I’m happy I don’t have this huge risk on my NFT balance sheet any longer.</p>

<p>Entry points: For me, 0.59, 0.6 and 0.89… which I almost sold at the 3.1 top (I called it, but my wife talked me out of it “because it will go higher!” 🤦). I then doubled down on this mistake by buying another one at 2.2 “to flip”, after doing a bit of switcheroo to get a rainbow mane lion (sold one I didn’t like for 3.1 and bought the one I wanted for 2.99). On the whole, my exit price then was: 1.045, 1.14, 1.15, 1.04, which works out as a 0.095 increase - but that got more than eaten up by royalties.</p>

<p>My wife only made the first trading mistake, not the second one, so she got off much better despite a higher entry: 0.85, 0.78 and 0.8 entry point. 1.19, 1.17 and 1.046 exits, for a nearly 1 eth profit (of course diminished by royalties and OpenSea fees and gas).</p>

<p>Got Whitelist for this project via Llamaverse. I looked at it and it seems interesting but I didn’t feel drawn to staying invested in it long term.

<p>I bought into this because it was a Llamaverse call (back in that post-bull period where the calls were lower quality). It’s not a rug, but it’s not a project I should ever have bought into. I think there might be some long term sustainable value here, based on the roadmap and how the project sees itself, however it’s not value that I believe in so I should not have gone in.</p>

<p>In an unlikely turn of events, I somehow miraculously sold all of them for most of what I paid for them, and a couple at a decent discount.</p>

<p>Can’t believe I spent a thousand bucks on some of those. 🙄</p>

<h4 id="pixelmon"><a name="pixelmon"></a>Pixelmon</h4>

<p>Yes, the infamous Pixelmon that raised $70m+ with undoxxed founders, no vesting, no strings attached.</p>

<p>I got the whitelist from Llamaverse. Much like PxQuest, it’s a project that I believe is honest (despite the outrageous valuations), and this presented me with a simple trading opportunity. Mint was 0.6 Eth. Floor was slightly above 1. So I flipped for 0.44 in profit (minus royalties). For 7 minutes of work that was not bad.</p>

<p>Best of luck to the project and its enormous expectations!</p>

<p>Update: Well, it turned out not to be all that honest, but I didn’t know it at the time 🤷</p>

<p>I was gifted my profile picture from Koollamas, and was also given a 1/1:</p>

<p>I also minted this one for free:</p>

<p>I have no intention of selling either. They’re pretty cool. Or Kool?</p>
